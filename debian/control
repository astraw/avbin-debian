Description: cross-platform media decoding library
 AVbin is a thin wrapper around FFmpeg, providing binary compatibility
 for applications and languages that need it.
 FFmpeg is a collection of audio and video codecs widely used in
 projects such as mplayer, xine, GStreamer and VLC. It is under
 continuous development; so much so that its developers rarely provide
 a release, and SVN snapshots of the library must be statically linked
 to avoid version incompatibilities.
